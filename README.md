      <li><a href="https://github.com/Nsb2020/Loan-Default-Prediction-">Prediction of SuperLender Loan Defaulters:</a> This project was aimed at predicting if a loan was good (1) or bad (0) using the borrower's information as the training set. It helps the SuperLender's loan officer make a calculated decision based on repayment odds, which in turn determines if an applicant should get a loan and, if so, what the size, price, and tenure of the offer will be.
